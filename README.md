🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to explore the trends in cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations across countries and continents over time. The goal is to extract insights from the pandemic data and present them using visualizations and statistical summaries.

📊 Project Objective

- Track the global progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Compare total and daily testing rates by country.
- Analyze vaccination rollout over time.
- Explore the relationship between human development and COVID-19 impact.
- Provide visual insights using Jupyter Notebook and Power BI dashboards.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes daily COVID-19 statistics for countries and continents with the following fields:

- country, continent – Geographic location
- date – Observation date
- total_cases, new_cases – Cumulative and daily reported cases
- total_deaths, new_deaths – Cumulative and daily reported deaths
- total_tests, new_tests – Testing numbers
- total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated – Vaccination data
- population – Country population
- human_development_index – HDI score
- Per capita metrics (e.g., total_cases_per_million, new_deaths_per_million, etc.)

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
  - Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis
- Power BI – Dashboard and report creation

📈 Key Insights

- Identify countries with the highest and lowest case/death/vaccination rates.
- Understand the impact of development on pandemic spread.
- Track time-based trends globally and across continents.
- Highlight gaps in testing and vaccine distribution.

📬 Future Improvements

- Automate updates using APIs like Our World In Data.
- Add country-wise predictive models.
